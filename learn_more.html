  <h1>Why Weather Forecast?</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Weather Forecasting is important since it helps determine future climate expectations. Through the
      use
      of latitude, one can determine the likelihood of snow and hail reaching the surface. You can also be able to
      identify
      the thermal energy from the sun that is accessible to a region.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Climatology is the scientific study of climates, which is defined as the mean weather conditions over a period of
      time.
      A branch of study within atmospheric sciences, it also takes into account the variables and averages of short-term
      and
      long-term weather conditions.

  <h1>How Weather Forecasting is useful?</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of weather forecasting is to protect human lives and property, improve health, safety, and
      economic
      prosperity.

      Weather prediction positively impacts people's lives in various ways:

      <h3>#1 Weather Forecasting benefits to tourism</h3>
      <p>
        No doubt, tourism is strongly affected by climate and weather. The increasing fluctuations of weather may affect
        tourists and tourism businesses. Thus, weather forecasting helps in planning tourism facilities to minimize the
        damage
        caused by severe weather, as well as increase profitability.

      <h3>#2 Weather forecasting improves transportation safety</h3>
      <p>
        Weather strongly impacts the safety and operation of roads. Driving abilities can be impaired by severe weather
        conditions like snow, rain, or storm. Moreover, There has been a slew of traffic accidents reportedly caused by bad
        weather.
        
        For air transportation, weather forecasters help reduce flight delays, flight times, and energy savings, and ensure the
        safety and comfort of passengers.

      <h3>#3 Weather forecasting beneficial to dressing</h3>
      <p>
        It&#39;s true that weather affects how we choose outfits. It&#39;s not easy to dress well in unusual weather conditions, though
        your wardrobe is filled with multiple items.
        
        For example, you have an outdoor meeting tomorrow but you don&#39;t know how to dress properly. That&#39;s where weather
        forecasts come in handy.

      <h3>#4 Weather forecasting is beneficial to farmers</h3>
      <p>
        Temperature, humidity, and precipitation play an important role in the cultivation of fruits and vegetables.
        
        Farmers previously predicted the weather based on observations of the sky. However, the development of meteorology these
        days has provided them with accurate weather forecasts by using supercomputers to collect data.
        
        By regularly checking weather forecasts, farmers are able to know the best time for crops and farming practices and
        better understand and track the growth status to make potentially costly decisions.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3>#5 Weather forecasting enables planning properly</h3>
      <p>

  <h1>Is Weather Forecasting Accurate?</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Many apps provide 24-hour weather forecasts with an accuracy of up to 97%. If you want to know how the weather is going
      to be in the next 5 days, a weather forecast can give 90% of what you expect.
      
      80% is for an accurate 7 day weather forecast. Many meteorologists agree that weather can be predicted with high
      accuracy for up to 10 days in advance.<br>
      It&#39;s impossible to collect data from the future. Hence, weather forecasts use estimates and assumptions, which can be
      less accurate for the further future as the weather constantly changes.<br>
      Understanding the enormous benefits of weather forecasting, many sites try to offer long-term weather forecasts in
      advance (more than 10 days forwards).
